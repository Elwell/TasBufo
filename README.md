# TasBufo Board

This project is inspired by the 'TOADS' CM108B digital interface board by Steve McGrane KM9G (Temporarily Offline) & Jonathan Kayne KM4CFT. While theirs is a nice compact 40x30mm board with a 12 pin header to break out the audio + some GPIOs from the sound chip, there's no possibility to expand beyond the capabilities of the CM108B itself - no extra serial port or lots of GPIO.

Yes, I am also aware of (and own) the excellent digirig mobile interface which has serial (in selectable voltages) AND sound, but again it's not *quite* what I want. so the tasbufo was born

## Features
* Built-in USB hub - only one cable needed to computer
* Genuine CM108B sound chip - Works with allstarlink trivially
* Serial-USB interface allowing control of serial devices (did someone say CAT control?)
* USB Header on board - Can be coupled with custom daugherboard for future expansion

## Availability
Right now, this is just a kicad design. Once I have some test boards back from the fab plant, I'll see how well they behave and possibly have some for sale.
